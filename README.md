chromatic
=========

A small musical utility to break down chords, scales and progressions.  
Currently only used from the command line.

Usage
-----

For simplicity, chromatic only speaks in sharp notes, as opposed to flats.  
Only triad chords are supported, and are notated in guitarist's shorthand as follows:
* `C` - C Major
* `Cm` - C Minor
* `Ca` - C Augmented
* `Co` - C Diminished
* `Csus4` - C Suspended Fourth
* `Csus2` - C Suspended Second

chromatic is case insensitive.

### Displaying a chord

    chromatic.exe chord <chord shorthand>

For example,

    D:\dev>chromatic chord G#sus2
    Chord G# Suspended Second:
    - G#-A#-D#

### Displaying a scale

    chromatic.exe scale <scale shorthand>

For example,

    D:\dev>chromatic scale F#m
    Scale F# Minor:
    - F#-G#-A-B-C#-D-E
    Chords in F# Minor:
    - F# Minor
    - G# Diminished
    - A Major
    - B Minor
    - C# Minor
    - D Major
    - E Major

### Displaying a chord progression

    chromatic.exe progression <progression> <scale shorthand>

For example,

    D:\dev>chromatic progression i-vi-iv-v F#m
    Chord progression i-VI-iv-v in F# Minor:
    - F# Minor
      F#-A-C#
    - D Major
      D-F#-A
    - B Minor
      B-D-F#
    - C# Minor
      C#-E-G#
